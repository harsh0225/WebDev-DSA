            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p id="para">
                Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the 
                creator and principal developer of the Linux kernel, which is the kernel 
                for a number of operating systems. He also created the version control system Git.
                Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He studied 
                computer science at the University of Helsinki, and he developed the Linux kernel 
                as a student project in 1991. Since then, the Linux kernel has become one of the most 
                widely used kernels in the world, powering everything from smartphones to supercomputers.
